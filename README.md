# Computer-Vision-Learning

In this repository, we will explore **small projects and real-world applications** of **Computer Vision (CV)**. The goal is to build a strong foundation in CV by implementing various techniques using **OpenCV, MediaPipe, and deep learning models**.

ðŸ“š Learning Resources



1. **Hand Tracking** â€“ Detect and track hand movements using **MediaPipe Hands**.
